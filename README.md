        <p><i>1/11</i>, or January 11, 2001 is the day that I was embraced by the universe. I'll lead out with interesting facts about myself. I was born in Greenville, South Carolina. In elementary school, I was recognized for my leadership in a number of areas. I was in the choir, a safety patrol, a Girl Scout, a news anchor for our school, and participated in a program made to prevent bullying and was even able to perform at the peace center. I attended Beck Academy after, and I began to take French. I eventually transitioned from being in the choir to being a Violinist. My leadership roles in various activities prepped me for later ventures. I applied to attend Greenville senior high academy as a business student and was accepted soon after. At Greenville, I was a member of the Beta Club, National Honors Society, Art, and Photo Club, and the secretary of Future Business Leaders of America. I graduated with business distinction. I decided to attend UGA as a Biology major but changed my major to Psychology and picked up an AMSL minor last semester. I am going to be a Cardiothoracic surgeon. When I have free time, I enjoy watching basketball and football, writing music, watching horror films, and hanging out with close friends. I do not have a favorite movie as I tend to be indecisive but a few of my favorites are cheaper by the dozen, Halloween, and Austin Power's Goldmember. I can thank my late great grandmother for my being ginger. I can speak a little french, hence the UnOnze heading which translates to <i>1/11.</i> The following entries will be current, as this website will take on the role of a blog or Ediary. I hope you enjoyed this short bio, I did! </p>
